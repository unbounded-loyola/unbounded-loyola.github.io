								<p>Watch a short video on how Jesus has worked in the lives of our members 
									through weekly Bible studies! As young Christians, getting to know Jesus 
									throughout our college years is essential. We want to use this precious 
									time in our lives to grow closer to our Lord. 
									It's not an easy process, but we're here for each other :)
